Introduction to Microsoft Azure and AKS

Overview
This handout provides a concise summary of the key concepts covered in the session on Microsoft Azure and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It includes examples to illustrate each topic.



 Microsoft Azure
 What is Microsoft Azure?
- *Definition*: Azure is a cloud computing platform by Microsoft that provides a range of services including computing, analytics, storage, and networking.
- *Purpose*: Allows businesses to rent computing resources over the internet instead of maintaining physical hardware.

 Why Use Azure?
1. *Scalability*
   - Example: An e-commerce site can handle increased traffic during sales.
   - Example: A startup can scale its infrastructure as it grows.
   - Example: A seasonal business can adjust resources based on demand.

2. *Cost-Effective*
   - Example: Avoid upfront costs for hardware.
   - Example: Reduce costs by shutting down unused resources.
   - Example: Use reserved instances for predictable workloads.

3. *Global Reach*
   - Example: A global app can reduce latency by using regional data centers.
   - Example: A multinational company can comply with data residency requirements.
   - Example: A media company can deliver content faster to international audiences.

4. *Security*
   - Example: Use Azure Security Center for threat protection.
   - Example: Implement multi-factor authentication with Azure Active Directory.
   - Example: Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

Kubernetes

What is Kubernetes?
- *Definition*: An open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- *Functionality*: Manages containers, ensuring consistent application performance across environments.

Why Use AKS for Kubernetes Orchestration?
1. *Managed Service*
   - Example: Azure manages the Kubernetes control plane.
   - Example: Automatic updates and patching of the Kubernetes environment.
   - Example: Simplified cluster management through Azure Portal.

2. *Integration with Azure Services*
   - Example: Use Azure Monitor for cluster insights.
   - Example: Integrate with Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.
   - Example: Secure access with Azure Active Directory.

3. *Cost-Effective*
   - Example: AKS service is free; pay for VMs and storage.
   - Example: Optimize costs with auto-scaling.
   - Example: Use spot instances for non-critical workloads.

Setting Up an Azure Subscription and AKS Prerequisites

 Steps to Set Up an Azure Subscription:
1. *Sign Up for Azure*
   - Example: Receive free credits to explore Azure services.
   - Example: Access to a wide range of Azure products.
   - Example: Start with a pay-as-you-go model.

2. *Install Azure CLI*
   - Example: Use CLI commands to manage resources.
   - Example: Automate tasks with scripts.
   - Example: Access Azure services programmatically.

3. *Set Up Resource Groups*
   - Example: Group resources by project or department.
   - Example: Simplify resource management and billing.
   - Example: Apply policies and permissions at the group level.
